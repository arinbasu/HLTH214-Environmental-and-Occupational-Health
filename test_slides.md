# Introduction

- Occupational health 
- Health of occupations

# Question to ask

> In your organisation, you are responsible for health and well-being for the employees. A newly appointed employee, whom you do not know, seeks your appointment and tells you that he suffers from fear of heights. What question would you ask him?

# Seven principles of occupational health
- Protect, adapt, and promote care
- Occupational health is a distinct subset of environmental health
- Occupational hazards are specific to occupations
- NZ has interesting statistics of occupational health hazards
- Occupational epidemiology has distinct study patterns
- Occupational health has long established traditions
- Haddon Matrix

# Protect adapt, care and promote
- Adapt the work to the worker and worker to the work

# Garden worker
You are working as a health scientist looking after employee health for people working in a garden. What will you do?

# Principle 2: Protect workers from illnesses and prevent illnesses among workers
- Must be able to identify harmful exposure
- Must be able to assess the risks
- Must be able to prevent illnesses

# Principle 3: Promote health and well-being of all workers
- Study how people work best
- Arrange for best adjusted work environment
- Arrange for curative and rehabilitative services when they are availabe
- Establish primary care services

# Princple 3: Occupational health is a subset of environmental health
- workers tend to be exposed for longer duration and higher intensity of exposure
- Workers tend to be healthier and youngerÂ than the members of the general public

# Imagine you are studying illnesses at a workplace site

# Healthy worker effect

In which, sicker workers are likely to stay home and healthier workers are over-represented in the worker pool; This leads to lower estimation of diseases when workplace surveys are conducted

# Principle 4: You find out about disease prevalence in workplaces using surveillance

- You must know what toxins are present in the workplace to understand possible health conditions that can arise in the workplace
- Your cohort of workers are readily identifiable and you can follow them over time
- This principle is referred to as sentinel surveillance
- You can identify first cases of diseases among the workers faster
